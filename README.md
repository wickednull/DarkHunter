# DarkHunter
 DarkHunter is a dynamic and extensible web application security scanner (DAST) built for security professionals and developers. It features a user-friendly GUI and a powerful, plugin-based engine written in Python. The architecture allows for easy extension to test for new vulnerabilities. Out of the box, it uses advanced techniques like Out-of-Band Application Security Testing (OAST) to discover a wide range of modern security flaws, from common XSS and SQLi to complex, server-side vulnerabilities. By analyzing live applications or captured HAR files, DarkHunter identifies security risks and generates comprehensive reports to aid in remediation.
